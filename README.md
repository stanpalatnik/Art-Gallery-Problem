Art-Gallery-Problem
===================

Application which solves the art gallery problem in O(n^2) time. 

This is a school project which leverages C# and WPF to demonstrate the art gallery problem and how to go about solving it.
The user chooses points on a graph, and the program will try to determine the least number of points(or "cameras") needed to
see the entire area at a single time.
